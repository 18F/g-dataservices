# 18F Data Services

Data is critical to effective decision making, and 18F is ready to help your agency and the public get more value from your data. We work with you shoulder to shoulder, building up code and trust along the way to deliver effective, easy-to-use, data-driven applications.

We’re there throughout the lifecycle of a project to help your team: 
* Identify and communicate the problem you’re trying to solve
* Get stakeholders on the same page
* Define the scope of the initial version for testing 
* Build or contract out the prototype
* Scale up to production, including obtaining an ATO

## What our team can help you accomplish:

* **Data dictionary creation**: Analyze the content and structure of your complex data and determine if, and how, it can support an application.
* **Stakeholder alignment**: Coordinate with stakeholders across groups so they agree on what can and should be built with your data.
* **Data integrations**: Develop integrations between disparate sources and create maintenance processes to ensure long-term success.
* **Data application development**: Quickly build an application version that’s ready for testing and iterate in the open with user feedback until it becomes a production application you can be proud of. 
* **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)**: Build an API to make sure your system works seamlessly with the public or other groups in your own organization.
* **Data visualization**: Bring your information out of PDFs and into an interface that communicates your data in a way that isn’t just eye candy, but actually makes it easier to understand at a glance. 

## How 18F data services have already helped other agencies:

### Building community around open data: [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/)

The Department of Education had a tight timeline to deliver a data-driven website letting students and parents explore college data. Pairing with the DOE and the U.S. Digital Service, we worked with stakeholders to clean the data, and then jointly developed a public-facing application to allow outside groups to access the data. On top of meeting their program goals, DOE was able to create an ecosystem that has allowed over a dozen apps to build off the data, including Google Knowledge Graph. DOE also learned development techniques to continue improving the tool to meet the needs of their users and the community.

### Technical leadership for mandated and statutory actions: [DATA Act](https://beta.usaspending.gov/#/)

The Data Accountability and Transparency Act aimed to establish increased transparency in federal accounting, but it came with aggressive deadlines and many stakeholders. 18F provided data and acquisition expertise to the Department of the Treasury so they could hire an appropriately positioned vendor to build a data collection tool and a new version of USASpending.gov to display that data. Ongoing technical and development guidance from 18F helped Treasury and the vendor deliver project milestones on time while meeting the complex needs of stakeholders.

### From PDF to data portal: [US EITI](https://useiti.doi.gov/)

The U.S. Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative is the U.S. branch of a global standard to promote open and accountable management of natural resources. Before the Department of the Interior started work with 18F, their most valuable data assets were PDFs, which were difficult for people to access or interpret. We partnered with their team to combine six data sources into a visually rich website that allowed the public to interact with the data and learn the broader context. This web application was so successful that it became a model for other countries implementing the standards.

### Improving access to important government data: [FBI Crime Explorer](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/)

For decades, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has collected crime data from all over the country as part of the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. Starting in August, 2017, the FBI began working with 18F to create a digital tool that provides law enforcement and the general public with improved access to the UCR data. The UCR information has a huge potential audience including researchers, law enforcement officers, and the general public. The site allows the FBI to reach a far broader audience, promote citizen engagement, improve resource allocation for communities, and will lead to more transparency and accountability within law enforcement agencies.

### Legacy transformation: [FEC](https://beta.fec.gov/)

The Federal Election Commission has decades of campaign finance data, but people found it difficult to access. We worked with them to define and explain the structure of their large and highly-complex dataset. Together, we built an API to let the public build apps off their data, and we built a new website, FEC.gov, to expose the data and communicate their agency’s mission. Beyond serving their users better, the FEC was able to switch to cloud hosting and license-free technologies so they could decommission their legacy infrastructure, saving more than $1 million a year.
